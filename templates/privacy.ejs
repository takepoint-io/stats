                    website, Takepoint.io.</p>
                <p>At Takepoint.io, we prioritize transparency and protection of our users' privacy. This Privacy Policy

                <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
                <h4>When playing the game</h4>
                <p>For security purposes, Takepoint.io stores your IP address and user-agent when you connect to our
                    servers.</p>
                <p>Additionally, when your player-controlled character is "killed" in-game, Takepoint.io will
                    automatically submit
                    statistics for that session to our servers. These statistics may be displayed on our Leaderboards,
                    as well as on your Player Summary. They will not be deleted unless the associated account (if
                    applicable)
                    is deleted or has moderation actions taken against it.
                </p>

                    statistics saved, it
                    is necessary to have an account. When you register an account, we store the following
